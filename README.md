# VEX Pocket Fields

**3D-printable, scaled-down VEX Robotics fields for tabletop use, prototyping, and strategy planning.**
<br></br>

## 📦 Project Overview

**VEX Pocket Fields** are miniature versions of official VEX Robotics Competition (V5RC) and VEX IQ Challenge (VIQRC) game fields. They're perfect for:
- Mid-competition strategy planning  
- Team discussions around the pit table  
- Just being a cool display piece for your robotics lab

I started this project started during the **2024–2025 V5RC High Stakes** season, inspired by [AutomationDirect’s Rapid React FRC field model (2022–2023)](https://library.automationdirect.com/2022-first-robotics-rapid-react-3d-printed-field/). The High Stakes field was first featured in my pit display at VEX Worlds 2025 (Entropy 17711E).
<br></br>

## 🎯 Featured Field: *High Stakes*

The **High Stakes** Pocket Field was designed in **Autodesk Fusion 360** and printed on a **Bambu Lab X1 Carbon** using multicolor PLA. STL and 3MF files are available.

#### 1. Download the Files  
- Navigate to the relevant field folder
- Download the `.stl` files and import into your slicer
- Or, if you have a Bambu printer, grab the `.3mf` files from the `/Bambu Studio 3D Print Files` folder for native multicolor support

#### 2. Printing the Field  
- Models are optimized for standard **FDM** 3D printers  
- Minimal or no supports are required  
- Use your usual print settings or tweak as needed for your setup

#### 3. Assembly  
- Refer to the **Assembly Guide** in the `/docs` folder  
- Includes part lists, layout diagrams, and tips for gluing and assembling parts together
